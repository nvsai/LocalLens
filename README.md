# LocalLens
An app to help foreigners feel local.

Idea:
Do you have a friend who keeps talking about how they enjoy thier local cuisines and places,stories only locals know?
Have ever been in a situation where you need cash in exchange of upi transaction to visit a local place or buy a local good?
Have you ever got anxious on your phone at lowest battery percentage,U need a quick ride badly but no one was helpful to provide a little time to charge?
Have you ever wondered if you get to find a local buddy who can help you get best experience at the place you visit as a tourish?

If even a one question above triggered an "yes" from you then you are our primary user.

The story behind idea:
On June 28 2025 around 5.30 I reached vizag city I was there to attend an Google developer event (VIzag WOW 2025) .Now I had time from 5.30 until 10pm to explore before I could get into accommodation.
So where Do i start ?
I just google searched and saw comments in reddit about R.K beach Gemini Did suggest it too.
so good so far...wait to reach there its around 5km the rapido is expensive and local transport is not quite active when i was there.Also then after reaching the beach i needed cash to visit some attraction and there are so many attractions, so many food options but to be honest figuring it out myself evrything everytime is exhausting in the process i couldn't enjoy that much also I dont even know what must try,must visits I missed.

Now How about I have an app that can create a personalised Dynamic Itinerary based on local users feedback and previous vistors feedback?Also Isn't it awesome I could get a local friend that helps me get experience?
Thats the idea.
Also may be I could try to build some features that solves those little pain points like finding transportation,Cash exchange for UPI,Local stories,Fare check,Mobile charging points....
The app may not be fully built yet if you are reading this feel free to get in touch so we could continue to build this idea or maybe some other app comes that solves these pain points by then.
OdiGo is the name my GDG Friends gave for it.Thank you guys!!
